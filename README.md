# Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Netflix content library to identify key trends and strategic opportunities. The findings indicate a library heavily dominated by the Movie format, with a significant reliance on content produced in the United States. The analysis also explores content growth over the years and the most popular genres on the platform.

The primary recommendation is to increase strategic investment in international TV series to diversify the content portfolio and drive long-term subscriber engagement.
